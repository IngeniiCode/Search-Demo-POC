# Search-Demo-POC
Outspoken Ninja - Distributed search aggregator for locating exotic cars and collectable motorcycles.

## History
Originally developed in 2014 as a next generation survey application.  

Ingenii Group LLC was located in the NextSpace shared workspace and business incubator (Santa Cruz, CA). While there, I demonstrating a simplified Craigs List regional webscraper to locate cars or motorcycle I'd like to buy to several other enterpreneurs, and it was qucikly evident the buisness
model for Outspoken Ninja needed to pivot.

In October 2013 completely new business plan and product roadmap for a nation-wide Auto/Truck/Boat/Motorcycle Lifestyle search was born.  After 2 months of development, testing, working with users and potential partners, the first iteration of the search engine was born.

July 2014 saw Outspoken Ninja as US sponsor of the World Superbike Kawasaki satelite team at Laguna Seca, CA.

## Epilog
Unfortunately, the tool seemed to be ahead of it's time, and failed to gain enough traction, and I folded the concern in 2017.  

Since then a company, doing exactly the same thing as the Ninja search appeared.  The concept was validated; the timing and marketing just wasn't right.  

As the owner of a business, you take your failures, learn from them an move on.
